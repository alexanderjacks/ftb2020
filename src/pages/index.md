    For thousands of years, Chinese Medicine has turned to nature to find the
    answers to health and wellness. Through meticulous observation it was
    recognized that patterns seen within our natural environment also occur
    inside the human body. This discovery led to a medical system with numerous
    powerful modalities all designed with balance and nature in mind. In our
    modern world it may be difficult to see the connections our environment has
    to our body and health. At Well Forest Acupuncture, we use Classical Chinese
    Medicine not only to bring healing to ones internal environment, but to
    bring attention, care and connection to the ecosystems in which we all
    inhabit.

        In an Acupuncture treatment, thin needles are inserted into acupuncture
        points located throughout the body on channels. Each point and channel
        is used to treat a variety of ailments and improve overall vitality.
        Ancient Chinese diagnostic tools such as pulse and tongue diagnosis,
        along with a thorough intake help determine which channels and points
        should be used. Japanese non-insertive tools called Teishin, can also be
        used to access acupuncture points instead of needles. They are placed
        gently on the acupuncture point and qi is accessed without breaking the
        skin. Teishin are also used to release superficial fascial layers in the
        body. This can help with pain and aid in healthy restructuring of the
        musculoskeletal system all while calming overactive sympathetic activity
        and encouraging parasympathetic function.

        A gua sha tool is used to “scrape” around sore muscles and acupuncture
        channels to bring blood flow and qi to the area. Gua sha can leave “sha”
        marks or small sandy purple bruises on the skin.

        Cups are suctioned on to the body with fire and are either moved up and
        down channels or left in one strategic place. Benefits of cupping can
        include: increase blood flow to sore muscles, loosening of adhesions and
        restrictions in the tissue, increase immunity before or during a
        cold/flu and increased lymphatic output. Sometimes thought of as a
        “reverse massage,” the hallmark of cupping are the circular bruises seen
        commonly on athletes.

        Chinese herbs are used to form complex and individualized formulas to
        restore harmony and provide relief to ailments. It is often given as a
        tea or in pill form. Many Chinese formulas can only be accessed by a
        prescription from your licensed acupuncturist.
