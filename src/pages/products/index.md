        Asian bodywork ranges from Shiatsu that involves dynamic rocking,
        pushing, pressing of acupuncture points on the body to a gentle Japanese
        style of body work called Sotai which uses gentle resistance moves in
        conjunction with the breath to retrain the nervous system in letting go
        of old holding patterns. Other gentle forms of tissue work including
        myofascial release can be used to access bound up fascial layers and
        encourage long term healing.

        Cups are suctioned on to the body with fire and are either moved up and
        down channels or left in one strategic place. Benefits of cupping can
        include: increase blood flow to sore muscles, loosening of adhesions and
        restrictions in the tissue, increase immunity before or during a
        cold/flu and increased lymphatic output. Sometimes thought of as a
        “reverse massage,” the hallmark of cupping are the circular bruises seen
        commonly on athletes.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
