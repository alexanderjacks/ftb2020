  based off of thorough medical intake, diagnostic tools and how you present the
  day you come in to the clinic. Any combination of the following modalities can
  be used in your initial or follow up treatments:

        Asian bodywork ranges from Shiatsu that involves dynamic rocking,
        pushing, pressing of acupuncture points on the body to a gentle Japanese
        style of body work called Sotai which uses gentle resistance moves in
        conjunction with the breath to retrain the nervous system in letting go
        of old holding patterns. Other gentle forms of tissue work including
        myofascial release can be used to access bound up fascial layers and
        encourage long term healing.

        Cups are suctioned on to the body with fire and are either moved up and
        down channels or left in one strategic place. Benefits of cupping can
        include: increase blood flow to sore muscles, loosening of adhesions and
        restrictions in the tissue, increase immunity before or during a
        cold/flu and increased lymphatic output. Sometimes thought of as a
        “reverse massage,” the hallmark of cupping are the circular bruises seen
        commonly on athletes.

        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
        pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
        but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
        anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
        and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
        obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with
        a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
        or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the
        other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
        are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
        so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
