Kecia earned a Bachelors of Science in Psychology from Portland State University in 2014. It was there she discovered the numerous factors that play into health outcomes, from social and economic status to physical environment. The turning point was learning that the mind and body are not separate entities but have interplay with one another. Being a lover of nature, it was her dream to find a career that could combine nature’s wisdom with the mind body connection.

After working at a local herb shoppe in Portland Oregon and falling in love with western herbalism, Kecia decided to pursue a career in Chinese Medicine. She completed a four year Masters of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM) from the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM). She is a Licensed Acupuncturist with the Oregon Medical Board and a Diplomat of Acupuncture with the [National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)](https://www.nccaom.org/). Within the Portland community she has work as an intern at the [Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) Richmond Clinic](https://www.ohsu.edu/family-medicine/family-medicine-richmond), [Asian Health and Service Center](https://www.ahscpdx.org/) and [Sunnyside Clinic](https://www.clackamas.us/healthcenters/sunnyside.html). Kecia enjoys working with diverse populations of people with, but not limited to, musculoskeletal pain, gynecological concerns, headaches, stress, anxiety, grief and support through life transitions.

Every treatment from Kecia is thoughtfully tailored to the individual as they present in their treatment that day, all while keeping other determinants of health in mind. She is trained in both direct trigger point style needling that elicit strong sensations, as well as a gentle Japanese style of acupuncture that involves non-insertive methods, Asian bodywork and myofascial release. One of Kecia’s favorite things about Chinese Medicine is that there is very little information that *isn’t*helpful to Chinese medical practitioners. They take the time to fully listen to your story and experience because it’s all connected to the body. You know you are getting a comprehensive treatment that factors in all aspects of your being with Classical Chinese Medicine.

Born and raised in Oregon, Kecia is fortunate to have grown up with the fertile and diverse ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest. She feels an overwhelming obligation to protect this wonderful place that has provided so much abundance and joy.
